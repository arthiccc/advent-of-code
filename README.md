# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code puzzles. This project documents my journey through these daily coding challenges.

I am solving these problems to learn, practice different programming languages, and simply enjoy the process of logical thinking. It is a wonderful feeling to see the solutions come together.

## Progress - 2025

I have been working on the following days:

*   **Day 4:** Solved using Python.
*   **Day 5:** Solved using Python.
*   **Day 6:** Solved using Rust.
*   **Day 7:** Solved using C++.
*   **Day 8:** Solved using Zig.
    *   **Part 1:** 171503
    *   **Part 2:** 9069509600

## Usage

Each day is located in its own folder within the year directory. You can navigate to the specific day to view the code and the input files.

I hope you find these solutions interesting. Happy coding to you.
